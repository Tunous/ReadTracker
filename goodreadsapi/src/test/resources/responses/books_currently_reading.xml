                <description>Harry Potter is midway through his training as a wizard and his coming
                    of age. Harry wants to get away from the pernicious Dursleys and go to the
                    International Quidditch Cup. He wants to find out about the mysterious event
                    that's supposed to take place at Hogwarts this year, an event involving two
                    other rival schools of magic, and a competition that hasn't happened for a
                    hundred years. He wants to be a normal, fourteen-year-old wizard. But
                    unfortunately for Harry Potter, he's not normal - even by wizarding standards.
                    And in his case, different can be deadly. --back cover

                <description>Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts is full of new dangers. A
                    convicted murderer, Sirius Black, has broken out of Azkaban prison, and it seems
                    he's after Harry. Now Hogwarts is being patrolled by the dementors, the Azkaban
                    guards who are hunting Sirius. But Harry can't imagine that Sirius or, for that
                    matter, the evil Lord Voldemort could be more frightening than the dementors
                    themselves, who have the terrible power to fill anyone they come across with
                    aching loneliness and despair. Meanwhile, life continues as usual at Hogwarts. A
                    top-of-the-line broom takes Harry's success at Quidditch, the sport of the
                    Wizarding world, to new heights. A cute fourth-year student catches his eye. And
                    he becomes close with the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, who was a
                    childhood friend of his father. Yet despite the relative safety of life at
                    Hogwarts and the best efforts of the dementors, the threat of Sirius Black grows
                    ever closer. But if Harry has learned anything from his education in wizardry,
                    it is that things are often not what they seem. Tragic revelations, heartwarming
                    surprises, and high-stakes magical adventures await the boy wizard in this funny
                    and poignant third installment of the beloved series.&lt;br /&gt;--scholastic.com

                <description>The Dursleys were so mean and hideous that summer that all Harry Potter
                    wanted was to get back to the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. But
                    just as he's packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange, impish
                    creature named Dobby who says that if Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, disaster
                    will strike&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And strike it does. For in Harry's second
                    year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously
                    stuck-up new professor, Gilderoy Lockhart, a spirit named Moaning Myrtle who
                    haunts the girls' bathroom, and the unwanted attentions of Ron Weasley's younger
                    sister, Ginny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But each of these seem minor annoyances
                    when the real trouble begins, and someone -- or something -- starts turning
                    Hogwarts students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival
                    than ever? Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told?
                    Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects . . . Harry Potter
                    himself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--jacket description
